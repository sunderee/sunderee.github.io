        WHOA!
        
        Hey there, traveler. I'm sure you wanna know what kinds of nasty things
        I'm hiding here on this site. Sadly, none. Yeah, I know... I'm boring.

        This is literally just a simple static website. No SSR, no fancy tooling
        and CI/CD pipelines that take 42 minutes to deploy a 489 lines-of-code
        site. But, if you're looking for anything "spicy", well then, feel free
        to follow me on Twitter. Everything I write over there is completely
        uncensored version of me. All the opinions, tech takes, bad jokes, good
        jokes (questionable if they exist)... It's all there. That's who I am.

        Now, to make sure you don't feel like opening developer tools was for
        nothing, here's what we can do:

            1. If you're hiring, I'm always open for new opportunities. If you
                download my CV, all of the contact information is there. Make
                sure you write me an email/call and use a keyword "pavement".
                That'll help me identify you as someone who actually read this
                message and who has a matching "energy". If you don't use the
                keyword, no problem. I get it. How can you write a scouting
                email and introduce "pavement" in there... Beyond me! But maybe
                you're just the right kind of a talent.
            2. If you want to collaborate, feel free to ping me on Twitter. Send
                a DM, or mention me in a Tweet. Whatever you want, but that's
                the easiest/safest way to reach me for non-business-related
                queries.
            3. If you answered "no" to either one of the above two options,
                then may I interest you in doing me a favor? You can do this
                favor even if you're a potential employer/collaborator. Please,
                in the next 30 days, go to your social media and spread some
                positivity. Say that web developers coding in JavaScript are
                doing great job, tell your uncle who's fixing legacy software
                written in COBOL that everything's gonna be fine, or do something
                random, like congratulate a random person on their extraordinary
                achievements. Even if they haven't done anything significant,
                at least you'll share a laugh. Just make sure it's legal and
                safe, unlike writing code in Java. Just kidding. I love Java.
        
        Anyways, hope to hear from you soon, traveler. Or not. Stay safe.
        There's someone out there who loves you.
